# SC2KFix
A small tool to help running SimCity 2000 Special Edition on newer versions of Windows.

How to use:
- Insert your SimCity 2000 Special Edition CD, or mount your iso file.
- Copy the whole folder "WIN95\SC2K" to a place on your computer, you want the game to be installed in.
- Unpack my tool to the directory where you just copied the game.
- Run "SC2KFix.exe" in the directory, and say yes to run as administrator.
- If everything goes well, there should be a new exe called "SIMCITY_PATCHED.exe". Use this to play the game.
- Enjoy :)
